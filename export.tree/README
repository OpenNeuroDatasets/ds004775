Description: 
This dataset contains data on a free-viewing task of soap opera clips. 
Each participant viewed 15 clips, each lasting 180 seconds, presented in fully randomized order across three runs. There were three clips per condition across five conditions: (1) perception of main characterâ€™s behaviors as moral and perception of story outcomes for the main character as positive; (2) immoral behavior and negative outcome; (3) moral behavior & negative outcome; (4) immoral behavior and positive outcome; (5) neutral behavior (perception of behavior as neither moral nor immoral) and neutral outcome (perception of story outcome as neither negative nor positive). Between clips, a 30-second blue screen with a centered cross acted as a non-active baseline.

- Condition labels:
	- Moral - Reward: 1A, 1B, 1C 
        - Immoral - Punish: 2A, 2B, 2C 
        - Moral - Punish: 3A, 3B, 3C
        - Immoral - Reward: 4A, 4B, 4C
        - Neutral: 5A, 5B, 5C
        - Blue screen: baseline
  

Participants:
Participants include regular consumers (FANS) and participants who do not regularly watch the show (NON-FANS).

Data collection:
All data was collected in 2005 at the Michigan State University (MSU).
